/* /!\ Afterthought:
I could have entered console.log(Object.values(person)); instead of the for part
See here: https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values
I keep my method since it is asked to display both the keys and the values as a list, which I did
